INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

You will need:

	- A chimera distribution (ftp.cs.unlv.edu:/pub/chimera)
	- netpbm or pbmplus (ftp.isri.unlv.edu:/pub/mirror/netpbm)

Optional:

	- jpegsrc (ftp.isri.unlv.edu:/pub/mirror/jpegsrc)
	  If you want chimera to be able to handle JPEG inline images
        - ghostscript and ghostview (aeneas.mit.edu:/pub/gnu)
          If you want to be able to view downloaded postscript or have
          inline postscript images.
        - xv, xloadimage, or other GIF/JPEG/TIFF/... viewer to be able
          to view downloaded image files.
        - mpeg_play to able to view downloaded MPEG files.

To compile chimera, type:

			cp Common.tmpl.dist Common.tmpl
			cp options.h.dist options.h

			# for X11R5 or higher
			xmkmf -a
                        make

			# for X11R4
                        xmkmf
			make Makefiles depend clean all

If the compile was success, you can test chimera by typing

			test-chimera

If the test worked OK, you can install chimera by typing

			make install

You can use the '-n' flag with make to verify that everything will
work OK.

I suggest that you look at Common.tmpl and options.h to make sure that the
settings look OK to you.
