Chimera is an X/Athena Web client for UNIX-based workstations.
If you do not know about the Web then read the comp.infosystems.www
newsgroup or grab the FAQ from rtfm.mit.edu using ftp.
This program does not require Motif.

The Chimera distribution is made up of several parts:

               code written by John Kilburg.

lib            Run-time configuration files for Chimera.

mxw            These are miscellaneous X widgets written by various
               authors.

libhtmlw       This is the HTML widget.  It was written at NCSA.  You
               can find this code in the Mosaic-2.4 distribution.
               Read README.NCSA for more details.

Jay and Greg are the system guys for the engineering college at UNLV.
They have done a really nice job of setting up and maintaining the
computing environment here.  A lot of the development
work was also done on a Linux box.  I am grateful to Linus Torvalds
and the other folks (too numerous to mention) who have
worked on Linux.
