<h1>Chimera Help</h1>

<h2>Program Info</h2>

This is Chimera 1.62, written by John Kilburg (john@cs.unlv.edu)
and others (see the README file in the chimera distribution for more info).
The HTML widget code was originally written at
NCSA.  Keep in mind that the HTML widget used by Chimera is a
modified version and any problems are John's fault.

<h2>Bug Reports</h2>

The name of the mailing list is bug-chimera@cs.unlv.edu.  If you want
to join the list, send email to bug-chimera-request@cs.unlv.edu.  Send
bug reports to bug-chimera@cs.unlv.edu.

<p>

When you send a bug report please include the version of chimera that
you are using, the type of machine/OS you are using, and one or more
URLs that expose the bug.

<h2> Mouse Button Usage </h2>

If you click on an anchor with the first mouse button then the
document will be loaded and displayed (if possible).  If the second
mouse button is used then Chimera will ask for a filename and save
the document to the file.

<h2> Quit </h2>

Clicking on this button causes Chimera to stop execution.  It is important
that you use this button instead of, say, control-c.
For instance, if you do not use the Quit button to exit Chimera any changes
you make to the list of bookmarks will not be saved.

<h2> Open</h2>

This command tells Chimera to display a requester for a document
URL.  The cursor automatically warps to the text entry field so
move movement is not required after the button is pressed.  A click
on the cancel button on the requester causes Chimera to discard the
requester and resume operation as before.  A click on the OK button
causes Chimera to attempt to load the specified document.  If the
URL is invalid or the document is unavailable then an error message
is displayed.  If the document was successfully accessed then
Chimera displays the document (in the case of HTML) or executes
an external program to deal with the document.

<p>

You can also edit the URL display field which is located between the
main document window and the document title display.

<h2>Home</h2>

When the home button is pressed the document that was first displayed
is displayed.  This is the same as pressing Back until the first
document is visible.

<h2>Back</h2>

Clicking on this button causes Chimera to ``back up'' to the previous
document.
This button will be deactivated if only one document is available.

<h2>Source</h2>

Clicking on this button causes Chimera to display the HTML source of the
currently displayed document.

<h2>Reload</h2>

Clicking on this button causes Chimera to reload the current document.
This is useful for a when the original document has changed (you are
currently working on a project, for example) and you need to refresh
the document.

<h2>File</h2>

When this button is pressed a popup window appears which can be used
to tell chimera to save or print the currently displayed document.
There are three text fields: Filename, Printer, and Email.  If you click on
the Save button then the string in the Filename text field is used
as the name of the file in which the document is saved.  If you
click on the Print button then the string in the Printer text field
is used to determine which printer to use for printing.  If you click on
the Email button then the string in the Email text field is used to
determine where to mail the document.  There is
also a menu button which can be used to select the output type.  Note
that when you print you must select the correct output type for
your printer.  If you try to print HTML on a postscript printer, for
example, then nothing will happen.  To print HTML source on a postscript
printer you will first have to save the document as HTML and then
use a utility (such as a2ps) to convert the HTML source to postscript
which can then be printed on the printer.

<h2>Help</h2>

Clicking on this button causes Chimera to display the document you are
reading now.

<h2> Bookmark </h2>

When you click on this button a list of bookmarks pops up.  To view a
document which has a bookmark just double click on the bookmark.
Along the button of the bookmark list window is a row of four buttons:
open, dismiss, add, and delete.  The open button opens the currently
highlighted bookmark.  The dismiss button hides the bookmark list.
The add button adds the title of the current document to the 
bookmark list (the URL is used if there is no title).  The
delete button deletes the currently highlighted bookmark.

<h2> Search </h2>

When the search button is pressed a requester appears which allows
you to enter a string for Chimera to find.  If the string is found
then the document position is changed so that the string is
viewable and the string is highlighted.  Chimera only allows
forward, case-insensitive searches.  If the search reaches the
end of the page, it will wrap to the top of the document.

<h2>Cancel</h2>

The cancel button can be used to stop the loading of the currently
loading document.  Note that cancel doesn't work while chimera tries
to make a connection to a remote host.  It only works once the
transfer has started (most of the time).

<h2> Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) </h2>

URLs are used by Web clients to access a document.  URLs describe
the access method to be used to access the file, the Internet hostname
where the document is located, an optional port number on the host,
and the location of the document on the host.

The format is:

<p>

access_method://hostname:optional_port/filename

<p>

Usually the port number is not used except when someone is running a
server on a non-standard port.  Do not specify the second colon
if the port number is omitted.

<p>

This may sound complicated but here are a few examples to
(hopefully) make things clearer:

<p>

Gopher server at UNLV - gopher://gopher.unlv.edu/

<p>

Web server at UNLV - http://www.unlv.edu/default.html

<p>

ftp server at UNLV - ftp://ftp.cs.unlv.edu/

<p>

Local file test.html - file:test.html

<h2>Hints</h2>

Chimera disconnects from a server as soon as it gets a document.  While this
is efficient in that it allows the user to browse data off line, it
makes it difficult to continue access on busy servers.  An example
(a really good one, actually), is ftp access on wuarchive.  Wuarchive
is a very busy ftp server so it is sometimes difficult to get a
connection.  The problem is that if you get a directory listing and then
select one of the items in the listing you may get a message like:

<p>

Could not load document ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub

<p>

This probably means that there are too many people on wuarchive.  In this
case just press ``Back'' and try again.

<p>

When you open a local file be sure to use
the file access method.  The reason for this is that if you give
a partial URL the current document will be used to complete
the URL.  If you use file: then the current document is not used
for context.

<p>

If for some reason there is a document that will not load correctly
try doing a reload.  If chimera was not configured correctly for
some reason, it is possible for the cache to be incorrectly
processed.  After verifying the configuration, press Reload to
make sure that the cache is processed correctly.

<h2>Environment variables</h2>

NOTE: The environment variables of the form CHIMERA* may go away at any
time.

<p>

Chimera uses the following environment variables

<pre>
WWW_HOME               This is used to specify the first document to be
                       loaded.  X resource is homePage.

USER                   Used to determine the username of the user running
                       chimera.

PRINTER                This is used by chimera to determine the default
                       printer.  X resource is printerName.

EMAIL                  Email address used for anonymous FTP.  This is needed
                       for users of TERM.

http_proxy             This is used to specify the server to use for
                       proxied HTTP requests.  The format is the
                       same as an HTTP URL.  For example,
                       http://firewall.blah.edu/

gopher_proxy           This is used to specify the server to use for
                       proxied Gopher requests.  The format is the same
                       as an HTTP URL.  For example,
                       http://firewall.mumble.com/

ftp_proxy              This is used to specify the server to use for
                       proxied FTP requests.  The format is the same
                       as an HTTP URL.  For example,
                       http://foo.bar.ca/

wais_proxy             This is used to specify the server to use for
                       proxied WAIS requests.  The format is the same
                       as an HTTP URL.  For example,
                       http://barp.nv.us/

no_proxy               This is a comma separated list of domains that
                       should not be proxied.

all_proxy              This is the default proxy host for all protocols.
</pre>

<h2>X Resources</h2>

Here is a list of Chimera-specific X resources:

<pre>
convertFiles           A colon separated list of files that describe the
                       converters.

homeURL                URL of the first document to load.

helpURL                URL of the help document.

path                   A colon separated list of directories to search
                       for viewer and conversion programs.

showURL                Boolean variable used to specify whether or not the
                       URL should be displayed on the screen.

showTitle              Boolean variable used to specify whether or not
                       the title should be displayed on the screen.

button1Box             A comma separated list of buttons to appear on the
                       first button row.  Possible button names are quit,
                       open, home, back, source, reload, file, help,
                       bookmark, search, and cancel.

button2Box             A list of buttons to appear on the second button
                       row.

printerName            Used to specify the name of the default printer.

cacheOff               If True then chimera will not cache documents.
                       Performance falls way off if you set this to true.

cacheDir               This is used to specify the directory of the default
                       cache.  Chimera will not create the
                       directory if it does not exist and caching will not
                       occur.

cacheTTL               This specifies the time-to-live for the default cache.
                       If a document is accessed and the cache entry for that
                       document is more than cacheTTL seconds then the
                       document is reloaded from the source.  If zero then
                       documents are never reloaded (unless the reload
                       button is pressed).

cacheSize              This specifies the maximum size of the default cache
                       in bytes.
                       If the maximum size is exceeded then the least
                       recently accessed cache document is removed
                       to make room.  If zero then the cache is allowed to
                       grow to any size.

cacheClean             If True then chimera will remove the files from the
                       default cache that it creates when it exits.

mimeTypeFiles          A colon separated list of files that map file
                       extensions to MIME content-types.

mailCapFiles           A colon separated list of MIME mailcap files to be used
                       by chimera.

bookmarkFile           The location of the bookmark file.

protocolFiles          A colon separated list of files that describe the
                       programs to be used for handling protocols.

statusUpdate           The number of times to update the download status
                       per read (or something).  Setting this to zero
                       gives the most updates while higher numbers give
                       fewer updates.

inPort                 The port number that chimera listens on for
                       incoming information from other programs.
                       By default, this is set to zero which disables
                       the feature.

languageDB             Specifies the language database file.  The language
                       database is a file with a name/value pair per line.
                       The name and value are separated by a colon.

httpProxy              HTTP proxy URL.

gopherProxy            Gopher proxy URL.

ftpProxy               FTP proxy URL.

waisProxy              WAIS proxy URL.

nntpProxy              NNTP proxy URL.

newsProxy              News proxy URL.

urnProxy               URN proxy URL.

noProxy                Domains with no proxy.

allProxy               Used to specify the default proxy for all protocols.

maxColors              Specify the maximum colors that a single inline
                       image can have.

delayImageLoads        This determines whether or not chimera delays loading
                       images.  If Chimera*delayImageLoads is True then
                       chimera will not download images until the user
                       clicks on the icon that is located in place of the
                       image.

cacheInfoFiles         It is a colon delimited list of cache info files.

cacheIgnoreExpires     If this is set to True then chimera will ignore
                       'expires' data from the information server.
</pre>

<h2>Configuration Files</h2>

There are five different types of files that can be used to change
Chimera's behavior: mailcap, MIME Types, convert, protocol, and cacheinfo.

<h3>Mailcap</h3>

The mailcap file is used by MIME-capable applications to determine how
to display certain file types.  For example,

<pre>
image/*; xv %s
audio/basic; playaudio %s
</pre>

tells chimera to use the program 'xv' to display all images and to use
the program playaudio (a wrapper for cat) to play basic audio files.
You can specify multiple mailcap files by using the Chimera.mailCapFiles
resource.  For example,

<pre>
Chimera.mailCapFiles:  ~/.mailcap:/local/infosys/lib/mailcap
</pre>

The entries in the mailcap files at the head of the list take precedence
over the following files.

<p>

Note that mailcap entries can have other fields delimited by semi-colons.
Chimera currently ignores all but the first two fields.

<h3>MIME Types</h3>

The mime.types file is used to map filename extensions to MIME content
types.  For example,

<pre>
text/plain            .txt .text
image/gif             .gif
image/jpeg            .jpg .jpeg
</pre>

You can specify the location of mime.types files using the
Chimera.mimeTypeFiles.  For example,

<pre>
Chimera.mimeTypeFiles: ~/.mime.types:/local/infosys/lib/mime.Types
</pre>

<h3>Convert</h3>

Convert files are used to tell chimera how to convert certain types
of files to other types.  For example, convert entries are used to
convert Postscript to PNM files for display as inline images.  The convert
file is also used to decompress compressed files.

<p>

An entry in the convert file is a single line of text of the form:

<pre>
usage in-content out-content command
</pre>

The 'usage' field is used to specify when the convert entry is to be used.
The usage field can be one of
<ul>
<li>inline
<li>any protocol (i.e. http, ftp, ...)
<li>any transfer or content encoding (usually x-gzip or x-compress)
<li>* (matches any protocol but not 'inline')
</ul>

Entries with 'inline' are only used for converting inline images.
Protocol entries are only used for a specific protocol (for example,
'ftp' is only used when a document was downloaded from an ftp server).

Entries with '*' can be used with any protocol or transfer/content encoding.

For example, you can specify the usage to be 'inline, the 'in-content' to
be 'application/postscript' and the 'out-content' to be 'image/gif' and the
command to be
'pstopxm gif8 %s' so that Postscript files can be used as inline images.

<p>

You can specify the location of several convert files with the
Chimera.convertFiles resource variable.  For example:

<pre>
Chimera.convertFiles: ~/.chimera_convert:/local/infosys/lib/convert
</pre>

<p>

In all cases, chimera saves the data in a temporary file and passes
the name as an argument to the command.  Chimera expects the command
to output the converted data on stdout.
See the convert file included with the chimera distribution for examples.

<h3>Protocol</h3>

The protocol files is used to specify external protocol programs for
chimera.  The format for protocol file entries is

<pre>
protocol_name        command_name
</pre>

The protocol name can be anything you want as long as it doesn't
include white space.  The command name is the <bold>full</bold> path
name of the command.  This is inconvenient but will work for now and
will be changed in the future to utilize the PATH environment variable
and/or the Chimera.path X resource.

<p>

The command should expect to receive, on stdin, an HTTP request
which gives information about the location of the desired document.
The program will know that chimera is sending data when a 'Content-length'
field is included in the header and the length is greater than 0.
For example, here is a typical header:

<pre>
GET /something HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Chimera/1.62
Accept: */*
URI: news:comp.infosystems.announce
X-protocol: news
X-hostname:
X-port: 0
X-filename: comp.infosystems.announce

</pre>

The first line can be ignored (it isn't really needed) but it is
kept around because that is what HTTP requires.
Note that the fields can arrive in any order and some may be missing.
A port value of 0 is used to indicate to the protocol that it is to use
the default port.  Also note that a field may be left blank in which case
the program is expected to pick a "reasonable" default or return an
error message.

<p>

Here is an example of forms data in a request:

<pre>
POST /mumble HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Chimera/56.34
Accept: */*
URI: news:alt.bogus.whimpering
Content-type: x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 46
X-protocol: news
X-hostname:
X-port: 0
X-filename: alt.bogus.whimpering

field1=mumble&field2=blah&field3=barp&field4=
</pre>

<p>

Once the program has collected its data it should output the data with
an HTTP header prepended.  For example,

<pre>
HTTP/1.0 999 Ooops
Content-type: text/plain
Content-length: 42

You specified a bogus newsgroup.  Go away.
</pre>

There must be a blank line between the header and the data.  You can use
the 'Location' or 'URI' fields to specify alternate URLs (or whatever
they're called now) for Chimera to load.  At the very minimum you
should include the Content-type and Content-length fields.

<p>

You can also use the 'Pragma' field to provide hints about how to
handle the document.  Currently, 'nocache' and 'nothing' is supported.
For example,

<pre>
Pragma: nocache
</pre>

If 'nocache' is present then chimera will not cache the document
which is useful for constantly changing information.

If 'nothing' is present then chimera treats the returned document as
a null document and nothing happens.

<h3>Cache Info</h3>

A cache info file is used to define the caches for chimera to use.
Lines that have as the first character '#' are ignored.  A cache
entry has the following fields:

<pre>
directory domain size TTL clean
</pre>

The directory field is the name of the directory where the cache files
are stored.  More than one cache can share the same directory.  The
domain field is an Internet domain name.  This is used to
determine which documents are put in the cache.  An asterick (*) means
that all domains are stored in that cache.  The size field is
used to specify the maximum size of the cache.  The TTL field is used
to specify the time-to-live value for the documents in the cache.
The clean field is used to specify whether or not chimera should remove
all of the cache files before it exits.  See the lib/cacheinfo file
for details.

<p>

There is a default cache in case a cache info file is not available
which is defined using cacheTTL, cacheDir, cacheSize, and cacheClean.

<h2>Slow Network Connections</h2>

If you have a slow network connection then you may want to enable
delayed inline image loads.  Set the X resource Chimera*delayImageLoads
to True so that inline images are not downloaded.
